# horiseon-code-refractor

With this project, I was tasked to refractor an already existing code to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. 

I ensured web accessibility was a strong focal point as it is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. This was done by adding alt tags to all images. All images were given detailed descriptions, this ensures people with disabilities have access to the website and can have an understanding of the image in front of them. 

The HTML and CSS code is a lot cleaner and more efficient after the refractor. This can all be seen in the source code.

## If you view the code refractor you will:
Find semantic HTML elements. - Prior to me touching the code I noticed there were many div tags, in fact, nearly all tags were divs. This of course made the code appear sloppy and overall hard to read. To resolve this I analyzed the code and determined where the main sections were as well as the subsections. After doing that I replaced a large majority of the div tags to semantic elements. A few examples of semantic elements used include: section, aside, footer, and header.

Find that elements follow a logical structure. - The code is now layed out in a way where it follows logical structure. This is done by giving elements proper indentation of parent and child nesting, making it really easy to read. 

Find a concise, descriptive title. - The title was non-existent before I edited the code. The title choice was pretty straight forward as it perfectly matches the website. I named it "Horiseon" as that is the name of the marketing agency.

Find a cleaner more condensed CSS code. - When I first opened the CSS code , I noticed that there was a lot of repeating styles but with different class names. To remedy this I created a new class name all together and just copied the styling over that was repeating. I did this process about three times and by the end the code looked a lot more compact and neat.
